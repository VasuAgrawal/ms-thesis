\begin{abstract}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item People (first responders and warfighters) need to gain rapid situational awareness about unknown subterranean environments.
	\item This is typically done by sending people in.
	\item These environments are very poor (rough terrain, terrible lighting, etc), making it difficult for standard robots / robot algorithms.
	\item This work presents the development of a multimodal object detection and localization system.
	\item Specifically, we cover the development of two iterations of a modular sensing platform, algorithms to detect and localize artifacts across multiple sensing modalities, and data transmission techniques to ensure timely updates for human operators.
	\item We show that the use of multiple sensors and sensing modalities is necessary and advantageous in detecting and localizing objects as a form of situational awareness in these difficult underground environments.
	\item Also, this localization system is aware of slam updates / key poses, and can maintain global consistency with the SLAM setup.
	\item Final evaluations are provided against the DARPA SubT challenge tunnel circuit environment ground truth.
\end{enumerate}

% The other requirements Catherine has:
%
%  - avoid large margins.  She wants the thesis to use fewer pages, 
%    especially if it requires colour printing.
%
%  - The thesis should be formatted for double-sided printing.  This
%    means that all chapters, acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.
%    should start on odd numbered (right facing) pages.
%
%  - You need to use the department standard tech report title page.  I
%    have tried to ensure that the title page here conforms to this
%    standard.
%
%  - Use a nice serif font, such as Times Roman.  Sans serif looks bad.
%
% Other than that, just make it look good...
